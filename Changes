1.12044908 2010-11-07T20:08:27Z
 - Stronger deps on MetaNoIndex
 - Moved t/ to corpus
 - Note: upstream deps moved meta_no_index to default to ON.
 - Minor bumped to match MetaProvides.
 - Contents is stashed in a File::Temp before handing it to
   Module::Extract::* for portability reasons ( I can't guarantee a passed
   file exists on disk, and ME needs them on disk to work )
 - Added some tests that mean something.

1.11044404 2010-11-02T16:58:53Z
 - Update dist info.
 - Integrated the new meta_noindex / _apply_meta_noindex behaviour added to
   the role.

1.11034304 2010-07-25T16:18:01Z
 - Improved documentation so people don't need to do so much link checking.
   ( This is pretty much an acknowledgement that this side package, which
   was largely just a side-effect of the one designated for MX::D, has
   attained so much unexpected use that it warrants being the primary
   reason to install this plugin =) )
 - Cleaned further deps on 'aliased'.

1.11034201 2010-07-24T13:38:32Z
 - History forks here from Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvides

1.10034117 2010-07-24T05:37:49Z
 - Dropped xt/author/kwalitee.t to avoid the needless dep. ( Kwalitee Test
   plugin doesn't have this issue )

1.10027802 2010-05-22T13:08:02Z
 - Replaced most of dist.ini with @KENTNL ( Yeilding more accurate t/
   depends )
 - Removed =inc::Dist style loopback in favour of the more reliable and
   more generic =inc::lib

1.10027518 2010-05-20T05:33:10Z
 - Upgraded tests to Dist::Zilla 2.x. ( should resolve rt #56482 ) ( Thanks
   to DAXIM/Lars Dɪᴇᴄᴋᴏᴡ 迪拉斯 for reporting )
 - Upgraded dist.ini to Dist::Zilla 2.x

1.10001919 2009-09-12T06:17:57Z
 - Dropped the version dep on FindBin because it causes problems for some.
   Apparently deping on something that may or may not be in core which may
   or may not be in core later is a bad thing.
 - Added CompileTests
 - Add dist.ini to release for diagnostic reasons.

1.10000417 2009-08-28T04:52:32Z
