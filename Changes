 [00 IMPORTANT CHANGES]
 - previous versions had no support for standardised ways of hiding various types of internal packages as identified in
   rt#74675.
 - this release attempts to remedy that problem but incurs significant changes to facilitate this, which may cause
   potential problems for existing code.
 - however, its deemed incredibly unlikely that you have a legitimate use for any of the problems that this release
   might raise.
 - If you use the "package # comment \n packagename" formatting, that package name will no longer be indexed ( was in
   previous versions )
 - If you prefix a token with _, that entire namespace will be ignored, e.g.: _Foo , Foo::_Bar , Foo::_Bar::Baz and
   Foo::Bar::_Baz are all ignored.
 - the namespaces 'main' and 'DB' will be arbitrarily ignored. Its deemed unlikely you have a legitimate use for trying
   to 'provide' those 2 packages, and now, if you so happen to use them, they'll be helpfully ignored. ( Previously,
   people had to use meta_noindex to exclude that pesky DB entry )

 [Bugs]
 - rt#74675 Should hopefully be resolved by this release, thanks be to XDG/David Golden for reporting this bug and
   providing helpful advice on how to handle it, as well as his contributions to Module::Metadata which this code now
   uses.

 [Dependencies]
 - use Module::MetaData, MooseX::Types::Moose
 - upgrade MetaProvides
 - Remove Module::Extract::*

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.12060502, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - runtime: +3 ↑2 -3 (suggests: -1)
 - test: +1

 [Internals]
 - Now uses  Module::Metadata for both package and version probing.
 - the namespaces 'main' and 'DB' will now be automatically ignored and not injected into the provides map for any
   reason.
 - namespaces masked with the standard 'package # comment \n packagename' style are now ignored.
 - namespaces with a leading underscore in any token ( ie: _Foo::Bar or Foo::_Bar ) are ignored.
 - Files are no longer required to be sloshed out into a tempdir in order to be scanned. ( Yielding a minor performance
   boost )
 - internal debugging is slightly more verbose

 [Packaging]
 - Retroactively fixing changelog because something blew it away last time.
 - Added a .perltidyrc

 [Tests]
 - Added a test for correct behaviour of "private" and "hidden" packages of various standard forms.

1.12060502 2012-02-04T03:50:41Z
 [Dependencies]
 - declare Data::Dump and a minimum perl as deps.

 - Dependencies changed since 1.12044908, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - develop: +1 -1 (recommends: +1 -1, suggests: +1 -1)

 [Internals]
 - Minor refactors to make Critic happy about the complexity.

 [Packaging]
 - Move to @Author::KENTNL
 - Tighten Critic.
 - Rework Changes for CPAN::Changes.

 [Tests]
 - added CPAN::Changes
 - removed Portabilty

1.12044908 2010-11-07T20:08:27Z
 - Stronger deps on MetaNoIndex
 - Moved t/ to corpus
 - Note: upstream deps moved meta_no_index to default to ON.
 - Minor bumped to match MetaProvides.
 - Contents is stashed in a File::Temp before handing it to Module::Extract::* for portability reasons ( I can't
   guarantee a passed file exists on disk, and ME needs them on disk to work )
 - Added some tests that mean something.

 [Dependencies]
 - Use File::Temp and a few other test tools
 - Use newer MetaProvides bases.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.11044404, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - build: +1
 - configure: +1

 - runtime: -8
 - test: -4

1.11034304 2010-07-25T16:18:01Z
 - Improved documentation so people don't need to do so much link checking. ( This is pretty much an acknowledgement
   that this side package, which was largely just a side-effect of the one designated for MX::D, has attained so much
   unexpected use that it warrants being the primary reason to install this plugin =) )

 [Dependencies::Removed / runtime requires]
 - aliased

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 1.11034201, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - runtime: -1

1.11034201 2010-07-24T13:38:32Z

 - Replaced most of dist.ini with @KENTNL ( Yeilding more accurate t/ depends )

1.10001919 2009-09-12T06:17:57Z

   may not be in core which may or may not be in core later is a bad thing.
 - Added CompileTests

1.10000417 2009-08-28T04:52:32Z
