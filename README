Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaProvides::Package

This is a "Dist::Zilla" Plugin that populates the "provides" property of
"META.json" and "META.yml" by absorbing it from your shipped modules, in
a manner similar to how "PAUSE" itself does it.

This allows you to easily create an authoritative index of what module
provides what version in advance of "PAUSE" indexing it, which "PAUSE"
in turn will take verbatim.

INSTALLATION

This is a Perl module distribution. It should be installed with whichever
tool you use to manage your installation of Perl, e.g. any of

Consult http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html for further instruction.
